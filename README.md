## Overview

We designed this project to give users a quick way to look up a book and find related videos in one spot. Users type in the **Title** of any book, and the *Google Books API* searches for matching titles. The cover art and title are displayed of the matching titles. The user can click each book and the *YouTube API* will embed related videos to the page. The user can watch the related videos on our site.
